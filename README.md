# FFmpeg Web GUI in Docker

A containerized web application that serves as a full-featured web GUI for FFmpeg. This tool provides an intuitive interface for uploading media files, configuring advanced encoding/transcoding settings, and managing processing jobs. It also integrates VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion) scoring to evaluate the quality of each transcoded file.

## Overview

This project provides a web-based interface for FFmpeg, enabling users to perform advanced encoding and transcoding tasks with ease. The application runs inside a Docker container, ensuring a consistent environment and simplified deployment. Users can monitor job status, view detailed logs, and even assess quality with integrated VMAF scoring.

---

## Objectives

- **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Offer an intuitive GUI suitable for both novice and advanced users.
- **Advanced FFmpeg Integration:** Support a wide range of codecs, formats, filters, and custom parameters.
- **Job Management:** Enable users to queue, monitor, and control transcoding jobs with real-time updates.
- **Quality Assessment:** Automatically compute and display VMAF scores for each processed job.
- **Containerization:** Deploy the application within Docker to guarantee consistency and ease of deployment.

---

## Key Features

### User Management
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login system with role-based access (admin vs. standard users).
- **Dashboard:** A summary view of recent jobs, system status, and resource usage.

### File Management
- **File Upload/Selection:** Options to upload local files or specify file paths accessible by the container.
- **Input Validation:** Checks for supported file formats and size limits before processing.

### FFmpeg Job Configuration
- **Preset Options:** Ready-to-use presets for common tasks (e.g., 1080p H.264, 4K HEVC).
- **Custom Command Builder:** 
  - Define advanced FFmpeg parameters including codecs (H.264, H.265, VP9, AV1) and formats (MP4, MKV, WebM, MOV).
  - Utilize filters for scaling, deinterlacing, denoising, color correction, etc.
  - Configure bitrate, CRF values, two-pass encoding, and other quality settings.
- **Advanced Options:** 
  - Integration with libraries like libx264, libx265, and libvmaf.
  - Custom audio/video stream mapping, subtitle overlays, and more.

### VMAF Integration
- **Quality Analysis:** Automatically compute VMAF scores post-encoding by comparing the source and encoded files.
- **Reporting:** Detailed job reports with VMAF scores, quality graphs, and log data.

### Job Management & Monitoring
- **Job Queue:** Support for multiple concurrent or sequential encoding jobs.
- **Real-Time Status:** Live updates showing progress, estimated completion time, and command status.
- **Logging & History:** Detailed logs for each job, with error tracking and historical data.
- **Notifications:** Email or in-app alerts on job completion or failures.

### Administration & System Settings
- **Resource Management:** Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage during transcoding jobs.
- **Configuration Panel:** Admin interface for system-wide FFmpeg defaults, Docker resource settings, and log management.
- **API Access:** RESTful endpoints for integration with external systems or automation workflows.

---

## Architecture

The application is built with a modern web stack:

- **Frontend:** Built using a JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or Angular) for a dynamic user experience.
- **Backend:** A RESTful API implemented in Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express) to handle job submissions, process management, and integration with FFmpeg.
- **FFmpeg Integration:** The backend constructs and executes FFmpeg commands based on user input while monitoring subprocess outputs.
- **VMAF Processing:** Uses FFmpeg's built-in libvmaf filter or an external library for quality scoring.
- **Database:** A lightweight database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) to track user data, job metadata, and logs.
- **Containerization:** The entire application runs inside a Docker container, ensuring consistent deployment and operation.

## Implementation Details

### Dockerfile Sample

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Install dependencies and FFmpeg with required libraries
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ffmpeg \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    nginx \
    # (Include additional libraries such as libx264, libx265, libvmaf if not bundled with ffmpeg)

# Copy application code
COPY ./app /opt/app

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip3 install -r /opt/app/requirements.txt

# Expose port 80 for web access
EXPOSE 80

# Start the web server (using gunicorn, for example)
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:80", "app:app"]
```

### Job Management Module

- **Command Generation:** Dynamically construct FFmpeg commands based on user inputs.
- **Process Management:** Use a task queue (e.g., Celery for Python or Bull for Node.js) for managing long-running jobs.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Implement WebSocket or long polling to provide live updates on job status.

### VMAF Score Integration

Utilize FFmpegâ€™s libvmaf filter to compute quality scores:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i encoded.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="log_path=./vmaf_log.json" -f null -
```

Parse the resulting JSON output to display quality metrics in the job report.

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Test individual modules (job scheduler, command builder, VMAF integration).
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Conduct pilot tests with target users to refine UI/UX.
- **Performance Testing:** Benchmark under load to ensure robust concurrent job handling.

---

## Deployment and Maintenance

- **CI/CD:** Automate building, testing, and deployment using continuous integration pipelines.
- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive user guides, API documentation, and developer setup instructions.
- **Monitoring:** Integrate logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) for ongoing system performance and resource usage tracking.
